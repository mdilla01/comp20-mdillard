##ASSIGNMENT 2 README##

DESCRIPTION:
	This project utilizes the google maps API to find your current location as well as the location of several "drivers" or "passengers" around you. The location of the drivers or passengers was received using an XMLHttpRequest, and the data was parsed from the JSON response. The locations were then printed onto the map display in the computer browser. When clicked on, an icon will display its associated username and distance from your current location.

IMPLEMENTATION:
	To my knowledge, all aspects of this project have been correctly implemented. index.html meets all the requirements of the assignment, and jQuery was not used.

HOURS: 
	This assignment took me approximately 7-8 hours to complete.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
	This assignment was completed individually. Some outside resources were used, such as Stack Overflow and Piazza.
