	<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This product is a web service that allows passengers to find drivers in their area, and vice versa. The program uses Google Maps API to identify the users location, and displays the user along with other users &lpar;either drivers or passengers depending on what the user is&rpar; on a map.</p>
		<p>I was hired as a security consultant to find any and all security and privacy problems in the program. These may include but are not limited to Cross Site Scripting, hidden fields, and bypassing restrictions on input choices</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>First, I conducted a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; test of the product. This consisted of my attempts to attack the site without reading the source code. I attacked commonly vulnerable areas of the program, such as input fields and queries.</p>
		<p>Next, I conducted a &ldquo;white box&rdquo; test of the product. This involved a review of the product&rsquo;s source code. This is where I would find vulnerability issues such as hidden fields.</p>
